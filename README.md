## 1. Core Features

This platform provides a comprehensive backend solution for company management with a focus on modularity, security, and maintainability.

### âœ… Mandatory Requirements Checklist

-   [x] **CRUD for Company:** Full create, read, update, and delete operations.
-   [x] **CRUD for Department:** Full create, read, update, and delete operations.
-   [x] **CRUD for Employee:** Full create, read, update, and delete operations.
-   [x] **Data Models:** All required data models (`User`, `Company`, `Department`, `Employee`) implemented with specified fields.
-   [x] **Auto-Calculated Fields:** Denormalized counters on models are automatically updated.
-   [x] **Employee Performance Review Workflow:** A state machine manages the full review cycle (`Pending` -> `Scheduled` -> `Approved`/`Rejected`).
-   [x] **Security & Permissions:** Implemented robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for `Admin`, `Manager`, and `Employee` roles.
-   [x] **Secure Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication.
-   [x] **RESTful API:** Follows REST conventions with proper HTTP methods and status codes.
-   [x] **Enhanced Admin Interface:** Includes a modern, user-friendly admin panel powered by `django-jazzmin`.
-   [ ] **Unit & Integration Tests:** (Project structure is set up, but test cases are not yet implemented).

### âœ¨ Bonus Requirements Checklist

-   [x] **CRUD for Project:** Full create, read, update, and delete operations for projects.
-   [x] **Production-Grade Logging:** Implemented a rotating file logger to track application behavior and capture errors without consuming disk space.

## 2. Architectural & Technical Decisions

This project was built with a production environment in mind, emphasizing best practices for scalability and maintainability.

-   **Modular App Structure:** The project is logically divided into four Django apps (`users`, `organization`, `projects`, `performance`). This **Separation of Concerns** makes the codebase easier to navigate, test, and scale independently.

-   **Data Denormalization & Consistency:** For performance, fields like `number_of_employees` are stored directly on the model. To ensure these counters are **always accurate**, **Django Signals** (`post_save`, `post_delete`) are used to automatically increment/decrement the values when related objects are created or deleted.

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Security is enforced using custom DRF Permission Classes. User roles (`Admin`, `Manager`, `Employee`) are defined on the `User` model, and these classes check the user's role to grant or deny access to specific API endpoints and actions.

-   **State Management with `django-fsm`:** The Employee Performance Review workflow is managed as a **Finite State Machine**. This library enforces the allowed transitions between stages (e.g., a review cannot be `Approved` directly from `Pending`), ensuring the business logic is followed.

-   **Efficient Pagination:** The API uses **Cursor Pagination** ordered by `created_at`. This is significantly more performant for large datasets than traditional offset/limit pagination, as it avoids slow `COUNT` queries and provides a stable ordering.

-   **Production-Ready Logging:** The configuration uses a `RotatingFileHandler` to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. It separates logs into an `app.log` for general information and an `error.log` for critical errors with stack traces.

-   **Configuration Management:** All sensitive keys and environment-specific settings are managed outside of version control in a `.env` file, loaded securely using `python-decouple`.

## 4. ðŸš€ Getting Started

The entire application stack is containerized using Docker, allowing for a simple and consistent setup process.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mostafa20220/company-management.git](https://github.com/mostafa20220/company-management-system.git)
    cd company-management
    ```

2.  **Create an Environment File**
    Create a file named `.env` by copying the example. The defaults are ready for local development.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
    This command will build the Django image and start containers for the web app and PostgreSQL database.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The API will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

4.  **Create a Superuser (Admin)**
    In a new terminal window, run the following command to create an admin account.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec django python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

---

## 5. API Documentation

The API is fully documented using the OpenAPI 3 standard, with an interactive Swagger UI.

-   **Swagger UI:** `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs/`

### Authentication

To access protected endpoints, first obtain a JWT token from the `/api/v1/auth/login/` endpoint. Then, include the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests with the `JWT` prefix.

**Example:** `Authorization: JWT <your_access_token>`

---

## 6. Security Measures Implemented

-   **JWT Authentication:** All sensitive endpoints are protected and require a valid JSON Web Token with configurable expiration times.
-   **Role-Based Authorization:** Granular permissions ensure that users can only access or modify data appropriate for their role.
-   **Explicit Serializer Fields:** The API uses explicit field declarations in serializers instead of `fields = "__all__"` to prevent accidentally exposing sensitive model fields.
-   **Environment Variables:** All sensitive information (like `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials) is managed via a `.env` file and is not hardcoded.
-   **CSRF Protection:** Configured with trusted origins for web-based interactions.
